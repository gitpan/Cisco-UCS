Cisco-UCS - A Perl interface to the Cisco UCS XML API

This package provides an abstracted interface to the Cisco UCS Manager 
XML API and Cisco UCS Management Information Model.

The Cisco UCS Manager (UCSM) is an embedded software agent providing 
access to the hardware and configuration management features of attached 
Cisco UCS hardware.  The Management Information Model for the UCSM is 
organised into a structured heirachy of both physical and virtual objects.  
Accessing objects within the heirachy is done through a number of high 
level calls to heirachy search and traversal methods.

The primary aim of this package is to provide a simplified and abstract 
interface to this management heirachy.
